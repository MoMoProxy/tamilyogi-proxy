What is a TamilYogi Proxy?
A TamilYogi proxy or mirror site is an alternative URL that replicates the content and features of the original TamilYogi website. These proxy sites host the same content but operate from different servers, often in locations where the original site is not blocked. By masking your IP address, TamilYogi proxies allow you to access the site as if you are browsing from a permitted region.
